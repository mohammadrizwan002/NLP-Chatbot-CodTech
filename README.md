 Task 3 – NLP Chatbot using Python (CodeTech-june2025)

Objective
This task involves creating a rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. The chatbot takes user input, processes it using lemmatization, and provides relevant responses.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- NLTK (for lemmatization only)
- Google Colab

Project Files
- `Task3_NLP_Chatbot.ipynb` – Colab notebook with working chatbot code
- `README.md` – Description and usage instructions

How It Works
- User input is converted to lowercase and punctuation is removed
- Words are lemmatized using WordNetLemmatizer
- A dictionary of predefined responses is matched against the cleaned input
- Bot gives a reply or asks to rephrase
